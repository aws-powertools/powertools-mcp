The Powertools for AWS [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a MCP implementation that provides search functionality for the Powertools for AWS Lambda documentation across multiple runtimes. It allows your LLM agents to search for documentation and examples related to the toolkit, helping you to quickly find the information you need to use Powertools for AWS Lambda effectively.

> [!WARNING]
> **This project is experimental and under active development.** APIs and features may change frequently without notice.

## ðŸ’¡ Get Involved

We're actively seeking community feedback and feature suggestions [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/B8zZKbbyET) or [open an issue](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-mcp/issues/new/choose) to share your thoughts.

## Use Cases

- Bring documentation and examples directly into your LLM agents' context.
- Search for specific topics or keywords within the Powertools for AWS documentation.
- Help your agents understand how to use the Powertools for AWS Lambda toolkit effectively.

## Getting Started

Most clients that support MCP can use this server out of the box using a configuration similar to the following:

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using an older version of the MCP, make sure to update your configuration to use the new package name `powertools-for-aws-mcp`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powertools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "powertools-for-aws-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This setup uses the Node.js package manager to run the MCP server locally and communicate with it using the STDIO interface.

## Development

After cloning the repository, you can set up your development environment by running:

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup:hooks
```

After that you can run tests using `npm t` or `npm run test:unit:coverage` for coverage reports.

You can also run the server locally using: `npm run dev`, this will start an inspector server that lets you interact with the MCP server using a browser UI.

If you want, you can also configure the server to run with Amazon Q, Claude Desktop, or other LLM clients that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by using `node` as command and passing the `--experimental-transform-types` flag and the path to the `src/index.ts` file of this project.

For example, with Claude Code, you can add the server by running:

```bash
claude mcp add pt-dev node -- --experimental-transform-types /path/to/project/powertools-mcp/src/index.ts
```
